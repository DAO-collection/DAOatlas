            <h3>Web 3.0 Will Nuke Social Media As We Know It</h3>
            <p class="f12 text-muted">Otc 3 · 4 min read</p>
            <p>I’m going to be blunt. Social media companies are pixel cockroaches. They crawl around the dark to collect things they don’t own. They follow you around. And the moment you think you finally got rid of them — they retarget you with their tiny offspring sneaking out of pixel-sized eggs embedded all over your belongings.
                Some say there’s a new roach killer in town and it's called Web 3.0.</p>

                <h4>Web 3.0 explained in a way that even your granny will understand</h4>
                 <p></p>
                <p>It’s a theoretical digital world where you own your digital data the same way you own your car. It’s the online privacy paradise Edward Snowden dreams about.

Web 1.0 is like a one-way train system — people can ride in one direction. Pretty much everything is up to the train.
Think early 2000s online news site, you can only read what a company shares with you. There is very limited user feedback so institutions didn’t really know so much about you. The company has pretty much all the control.

Web 2.0 is like a subway system that — people can ride back and forth between multiple locations, but they have to rely on the train to drive them there. The operators can also play whatever ads they like inside the train and even listen in to some of the people’s most private conversations to build profiles on riders.
Think social media. The company has pretty much all the control and they know every single trick to make users say: “Shut up and take my money!”

Web 3.0 is like cruising in your own personal car — you can go where the hell you want with it, it’s yours. It’s a place where you’re in full control. You can choose if you want to be surrounded by ads or turn that damn radio to the new Adele album. As long as you follow a couple of traffic rules to keep everyone safe, you’re good to go. There is no institutionary middleman.
Think Mark Zuckerberg’s worst nightmare. You’re in control of your data, and if big tech wants it, they can buy it from you.
It’s kinda simple if you take the fluff away.</p>
