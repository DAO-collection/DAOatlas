The idea of ​​a group of fans buying an expensive NBA team sounds crazy, but if you join the Krause House community, You will find that this is not impossible.

Krause House provides a communication space for basketball fans, sports fans, and e-sports fans. Everyone can meet here and hang out.

As a member, you have the opportunity to have a lot of funs includes ：

Attend AMAs with NBA insiders, professional, collegiate, and retired players, NBA media, agents, coaches, GMs, and insiders familiar with dealmaking in the league. 

Attend Game-of-the-Week — commentary from community members  with their own pick-em style games, and maybe even some half-time entertainment! 

Learn in Krause House University — workshops for the next 10,000 crypto natives. Philanthropic Events - Getting involved in local communities and organizations like NBA Cares, ONExONE, etc.

Play on-chain fantasy games and betting for rewards and the ability to climb the leaderboards and make your case for voice into the team.

Build Open Source Software, DAO Tooling, NFT Projects, and Brand/Media Partnerships

And more importantly, they are trying to realize their dream of buying an NBA team through various attempts in the community.

Owners, media, players, and fans each play critical roles in making professional sports businesses go and flourish. While fans are arguably the single most indispensable party to this equation, they are the lowest on the totem pole when it comes to ownership by order of magnitude or higher. Historically, the reason for this disparity is that there hadn't been ways for fans to coordinate or communicate at scale. Technology has begun to disrupt this model by giving fans a common voice, first through talk radio in the 90s, online forums in 00s and more recently through social media. Fans now have more influence than ever before - but it's still lacking. This is because without ownership, fans are seen as just a noisy consumer who has to be appeased without a real seat at the table.Web3 changes all that by consumerizing ownership. With web3, consumers finally have the capability to collectively own and coordinate at scale. This changes the game.

,CabinDAO,"CabinDAO is an experiment in universal creator income, the physical manifestation of DAOs, and decentralized cities. 

They built a cabin made of several containers in a 45-minute drive from Austin, Texas, which can accommodate four people and provided it to creators for free for a while. After the end of the free residence, the creator's creation will be mint as NFT and sold. Half of the income goes to the creator, and half of the revenue goes to the DAO. By today, dozens of creators have lived there for at least a month.

But this is only their first City node. They will do much more than that.

As a community of independent online creators, one of the first emergent properties of the community was an interest in finding better ways to freelance online. Members of the DAO have started forming ad-hoc teams to hunt web3 bounties publish content, and collectively produce art。

Cabin's community has a particular interest in fun projects that push the boundaries at the intersection of on-chain and off-line. While these examples are whimsical, the guild ultimately is where we help community members earn a living independently online. The guild can also serve as a talent network for successful community projects to tap into and recruit other collaborators. 

They are becoming a hub for DAO tools, knowledge sharing, and retreats—all supported by the guild that has grown out of our community and residency program.

If you want to work with creators, thinkers, and other leaders in the DAO ecosystem to build the future, join them.

In the roadmap for the next 12 months, Cabin DAO will:
Run ongoing residencies and retreat via the first on-chain lease controlled by a DAO. 
Bring on community support to help manage the IRL and online communities.
Develop the guild to empower members to make money independently online.
Invest in the community via Creator Fellowships, token/NFT purchases, and equity.","real estate,creative,social impact,social&club",CabinDAO,cabin.jpg,500,"A group of independent online creators building a decentralized city, create a home for DAOs, online and IRL","CabinDAO is an experiment in universal creator income, the physical manifestation of DAOs, and decentralized cities.

Most of the broad community interaction takes place in a token-gated discord server, where members swap ideas, contribute to the DAO, and support the current cabin residents:

The IRL community is made up of cabin residents, who are selected by the DAO and come for cohorts of 1-month stays to work on creative projects. Throughout the month, residents collaborate, get support from members of the DAO community, and develop their ideas into tangible projects. 

Part of CabinDAO's discord channels is open to all. Part of them are only available to members. To join their discord server as a member, you will need CABIN token, 1 token(about 30$) will be enough. If you don't want to buy it, you can check their community-bounties channel to find a bounty that fits you and earn the CABIN token.

There are two ways to join their IRL community.
1. Buy a passport.
These Passports are NFTs that can be purchased for 1 ETH and grant four people a weeklong stay at Creator Cabins. Each Passport grants the holder a specific Monday - Sunday stay in their four-bedroom shipping container cabin. Passports are transferable to others, but they are only valid for the week listed on the NFT. 

Cabin DAO's guild of engineers, artists, writers and builders will be available to help support your group remotely. Each Passport holder will be airdropped 10 $CABIN upon arrival to keep or spend on DAO services. 

2. Apply for a free residency
Any weeks that aren't sold will be used by Cabin DAO to run our free residency program for independent online creators. When they are open, you can apply via their discord channels.",high,"Jon Hillis,https://twitter.com/JonathanHillis;Corey,https://twitter.com/DugDaniels",CABIN,https://etherscan.io/token/0x1934e252f840aa98dfce2b6205b3e45c41aef830,206,https://etherscan.io/address/0x8dca852d10c3cfccb88584281ec1ef2d335253fd,"$2,500,000 ",https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth,,https://www.creatorcabins.com/,https://twitter.com/creatorcabins,https://discord.com/invite/N6hVmFygjR,https://foul-buffer-636.notion.site/Cabin-DAO-668930ccc2c64e8a958aacb2686e335f

The ultimate vision is to create a research DAO that's crypto-native and online.

They want to change the modern perception of liberal arts and re-establish it as a foundation to create a better web and participate in society and culture, especially as technology becomes increasingly ubiquitous.

They want people who care about web3's broader societal impact to have a place to ask questions, voice their thoughts, and learn with a community of peers.

Students could vote on where their tuition money goes towards instead of spending the budget on the football team. Speakers can gain ownership into the DAO when they deliver talks. Researchers can have a much faster process for funding grants.
