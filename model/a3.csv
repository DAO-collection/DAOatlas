138,"Crypto,Culture,&Society","This is a DAO initiated by a group of senior experts in the crypto world. They explore the impact of crypto on culture and society and turn the discussions into articles for a journal on Mirror. The ultimate vision is to create a research DAO that's crypto-native and online.

They want to change the modern perception of liberal arts and re-establish it as a foundation to create a better web and participate in society and culture, especially as technology becomes increasingly ubiquitous.

They want people who care about web3's broader societal impact to have a place to ask questions, voice their thoughts, and learn with a community of peers.

DAOs may serve as a new coordination mechanism to build educational entities where every stakeholder designs the experience together as owners.

Students could vote on where their tuition money goes towards instead of spending the budget on the football team. Speakers can gain ownership into the DAO when they deliver talks. Researchers can have a much faster process for funding grants.

They want to inspire more people to care about how crypto can help solve some of the greatest problems of our time, while simultaneously pushing to make this space as inclusive and accessible as possible.

They accomplish our goals utilizing new crypto platforms and incentives, like renting and lending assets (NFTs) to members who use them to earn tokens in P2E(Play2earn) games.
