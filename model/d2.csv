NULL,AMPLED,"Ampled is a Patreon-like platform for musicians, owned by its artists and workers.

It allows artists to be directly supported by their community without intermediaries or gatekeepers (and is collectively owned by its artists and workers).

They call themselves a Co-op, which means a company owned by its workers, customers, or both. In stark contrast to Silicon Valley ethos, they reject traditional venture capital and embrace radical transparency, democratic governance, and broad-based user ownership.

Although they call themselves a co-op rather than a DAO, their values are very consistent with DAO's: disintermediation, emphasis on fairness and transparency, mission-driven, and rebellion against the traditional world, etc. This shows that spirit of DAO is also nurturing at the other corners of the world, non-crypto world. They will eventually reach the same destination from different paths. 

Whether you are interested in an artist-autonomous community, or you want to compare the similarities and differences between a cooperative and a DAO, this community deserves your attention.","Creative,Music",AMPLED,Ampled_400x400.jpg,100-500,"A cooperative platform for musicians, created to make the online economy more fair and inclusive for artists.","Ampled is a Patreon-like platform for musicians, owned by its artists and workers.

All members can make proposals for community development or project development. They can also vote on proposals made by others.
Several defi projects, such as flashstake, aquafi, dropzero, ect., have been incubated by the community. Their NFT project Cryptonaut runs well too.

In our opinion, their community is well run, but several Defi projects are not very successful. Although the Defi projects have been audited, they are not open source and the technical details have not been disclosed too much, so we cannot give further judgment. We suggest readers sink into the community for more extensive and in-depth information before deciding to invest in their Defi project. In short, do your own research.
